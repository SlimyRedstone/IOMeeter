/*
 * Per-application volume control, the same thing the Windows mixer does.
 *
 * One API, two implementations chosen at compile time: Core Audio sessions on
 * Windows, PulseAudio sink inputs elsewhere. The Pulse client also drives
 * PipeWire through its compatibility layer, which is what nearly every current
 * distribution runs, so no separate PipeWire backend is needed.
 *
 * Applications are addressed by executable basename rather than by process id,
 * because a pid changes every run while "Discord.exe" does not. Matching
 * ignores case and any extension, so one configuration works on both systems
 * where the same program is "Discord.exe" and "discord".
 *
 * Not thread safe; call from one thread.
