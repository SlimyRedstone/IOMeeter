# Started by the desktop's own autostart, and the trigger the systemd unit is
# missing.
#
# IOMeeter.service is WantedBy=graphical-session.target, which only GNOME, KDE
# and the compositors that launch their session under systemd ever reach.
# Cinnamon, XFCE, MATE, LXQt and the tiling window managers do not, so the unit
# sits enabled and never starts. XDG autostart is the one mechanism every
# desktop implements, so that is what gets used to reach the unit.
#
# Two jobs, in order:
#
#   1. Push the session's display into the user manager. A systemd user unit
#      inherits the manager's environment, not the session's, so without this
#      IOMeeter starts with no DISPLAY and GLFW cannot open a window.
#   2. Start the unit, so its WorkingDirectory and its restart policy still
#      apply and there is one description of how IOMeeter runs rather than two.
#
# Falling back to running the binary directly when there is no user manager to
# talk to, which is a container or a distribution without systemd.
#
# Harmless where the unit already started on its own: systemctl start on an
# active unit does nothing, and instance.c would hand a second copy over to the
# first in any case.
